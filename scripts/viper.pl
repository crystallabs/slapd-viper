# Script showing how to run Viper as a standalone program, separate
# from slapd. Usage in this way is suitable if you want to read directory
# data while circumventing slapd but still getting the exact same
# results and code paths.
#
# Most notable use is running your search query of choice under Perl
# profiler, such as one of:
#
#  perl -d:DProf     scripts/viper.pl; dprofpp
#
#  perl -d:SmallProf scripts/viper.pl; ./scripts/sprofpp
#
# The script contains some hardcoded values, reflecting the specific
# issue that was being profiled the last time the script was used.
#
# There are no command line switches or options.
# To make the script suit your purposes you will most probably want to
# edit the source.
#
# To produce the exact same behavior as when running from slapd, Viper
# has to be initialized with the same config.
# One way to do so is to initialize both with the same options.
# Another option is to run a configured LDAP/Viper once, while having
# directive 'savedump FILE' at the end of database config. That will
# produce a Storable dump of the database's config. Then, instead of
# sending a series of ->config() directives seen below, you can just
# replace it with ->loaddump(FILE).

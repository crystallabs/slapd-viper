# Tool to retrieve schema from server in LDIF format.
#
# This is just a basic script that assumes unauthenticated or
# pre-authenticated schema retrieval will work.
#
# Apart from its standalone use, this is also useful/needed with
# the Viper backend because slapd does not provide slapd-perl with
# access to the schema.
#
# So, after starting the LDAP server, this script is run to download
# schema into a file, and then Viper's option "schemaLDIF" can find
# and load it, and thus become aware of schema.
#
# ./schema.pl [hostname]
#
# Example:
#
# sudo sh -c './scripts/schema.pl > /etc/ldap/slapd-viper/schema.ldif'
